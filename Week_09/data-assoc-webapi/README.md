## Read me - Web API with associated or related data

This folder has data files and a sample web API that works with related data. It can be considered to be an example implementation of the course notes document titled ["Data assocations or relations... document reference how-to"](https://bti425.ca/notes/data-assoc-doc-ref-how-to).

While the web API works with the professor's database, you must generate your own data, load it in to your database, and modify your Mongoose schemas to match your generated data. 

We have provided three sample data files that were generated by Mockaroo during the professor's work on this code example.
