## Deploy React app to Heroku

During development, your React app is "served" from an instance-based on-demand web server, to one of your browsers. 

Now, we will learn how to package the React app so that it can be deployed to a new Heroku app, and therefore available on the public web (so that you can get to it from your computer or smartphone).

### "Build" the app

Now that we have some React experience, why don't we actually "build" the application? 

As noted above, we've been learning and practicing our React skills in a controlled, "development" environment.  Once we're happy with the end result, we can actually "build" the application, which will generate a much smaller footprint, and make it hosting-ready.

If you take a look at the generated `package.json` file, you will see that the `scripts` property contains our initial `start` script (ie: **npm start**), as well as a number of *other* scripts that we can invoke.  The one we're most interested in here, is the `build` script (i.e. `npm run build`).  Once executed, this script initiates a "build" process that creates a highly optomized "production" build of our code in a new folder called "build".

Try executing this command by following the steps below:

* Stop the "development server" that's currently running 
* Execute the command `npm run build`

Once this process is complete, open the newly created "build" folder.  You will see that there's only a handful of files now, most notably, an `index.html` file and a `static` folder containing two or three sub-folders: `js`, `css`, and maybe `media` which contain your bundled JavaScript CSS files, and maybe media (images etc.). If you take a look at `index.html`, you will see that it's a small skeleton that references the bundle/package JavaScript files.

Now, all we need to run this in a "production" environment, is a static web server.  Fortunately for us, we know exactly how to create one using Node.js and Express.js.

Recall [from the previous level-3 web dev course](https://web322.ca/notes/week04), a minimal `server.js` file has the following code, which serves content statically from the "public" folder:

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var app = express();
var HTTP_PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080

app.use(express.static("public"));

app.listen(HTTP_PORT, () => {
  console.log("Ready to handle requests on port " + HTTP_PORT);
});
```

will treat a local "public" directory as a "static" directory!  All we have to do is create a new web server using the above code, and place **all** of our React.js production code from the "build" directory, into our new server's "public" directory. 

Once this is complete, we can run our new Express server.js file (`node server.js`) in the browser to see our production React.js code.

Remember: the server is only serving up static files to **build** the application on the client-side.

### Heroku hosting

During this course's week 2, you had another opportunity to deploy a Node+Express app to a new Heroku app.

Now, you have another opportunity. [Follow the guidance again](https://web322.ca/getting-started-with-heroku), and deploy the package you created in the previous section.
