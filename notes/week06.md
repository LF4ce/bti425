The theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

This week, it's all about *getting started with Angular*. Then, beginning next week, we'll do a weekly deep dive into these important app dev topic areas:
1. Components
2. Routing
3. Services
4. Forms

After that, we'll put together some apps.

### Friday plan

*Friday, February 7* 

A number of them today:
* History
* Orientation
* Big ideas
* Roadmap

Then, technical getting started topics:
* Install
* Edit cycle
* TypeScript
* Architecture
* Components

The recent coverage of React introduced you to a new way to think about building a client-side web app. Now, we do it again in Angular.  

To get started, read this [introduction to Angular](angular-intro), and also follow its links to read or skim additional content.

Next, follow along as you [get started with Angular](angular-get-started). Learn how to install the developer bits, and generate a starter app. Then, start learning about its architecture. Follow the tutorials. 

Then, we repeat or highlight some of [the important topics and concepts](angular-architecture) from the getting started guide and tutorials. 

<br>

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/resources).

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 

We have two code examples today:
1. Animals - an Angular version of the multi-component React "router introduction" code example from week 4 
2. Customers - the end result of the in-class demonstration 

<br>

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, February 11* 

We will do an in-class task, in which you will create a new Angular app, and learn through hands-on experience.
