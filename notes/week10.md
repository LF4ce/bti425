## BTI425 Week 10 Notes

> Friday, March 13 - classroom lecture  
> Tuesday, March 17 - hands-on in the computer-lab 

This week, we will make progress with *forms* topics.  

<br>

### Friday plan

*Friday, March 13* 

Highlights from this week's topics: 

Last week we were introduced to [Angular template-driven forms](angular-forms-intro). It's time to learn more. 

> Remember our previous coverage of  
> [HTML Form patterns](html-form-patterns). 

Then, we'll learn some techniques to improve the interaction experience users have with forms. And, we'll introduce data validation techniques. These topics are covered in this document:  
[Introduction to Angular template-driven forms validation](angular-forms-validation-intro)

The course's GitHub repo has a nice code example that covers the typical CRUD tasks. 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/resources).
